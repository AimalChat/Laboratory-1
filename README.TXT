This project is part of the material for the book

   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ
   Seventh edition

It is discussed in chapter 1.

This is a very simple project to demonstrate some characteristics of
objects.

You can create various shapes, and you will see, if you do, that those
shapes are drawn on screen (in a window that we call the "canvas").

You can then manipulate these objects: change their position, size and 
colour. Try it out: create a few different squares, triangles and circles.

This project is designed as a first example of object-oriented programming.
It illustrates a number of concepts:

 - a Java project (application) is a collection of classes
 - objects can be created from classes
 - from any one class, many objects may be created
 - objects have operations (methods)
 - operations can have parameters
 - parameters have types (at least String and int)
 - objects hold data (fields)
 - the operations and fields are common to all objects
 - the values stored in the fields can be different for each object

The project also demonstrates

 - BlueJ object creation
 - interactive method invocation
 - parameter passing

A good second project to look at after this is "picture", which adds a class
to those ones in this project. That class (named "Picture") uses the shapes
to draw a picture. It can be used to experiment with coding.

Aimal's Note : Im currently learning the very basics, shapes and classes! 
Im still terrified of what's to come during this semester but I feel thrilled having the opportunity to begin this new journey!

Lab report (part a = question, part b = answer to said question)

1a.Which files from BlueJ’s local project are uploaded to the repository, and which are not? Why do you think this is? 

1b.The files uploaded on the repository include : Canvas.java, Circle.java, Person.java, README.TXT, Square.java, Triangle.java, package.java. 
I believe that these files in particular stayed due to the .java extension they have, making them the only ones that can be modified in the IDE.
Since BlueJ's language is Java, it would make sense that the only files that are inserted in the IDE are the ones with the .java extension.
The other files weren't inserted due to their different nature (.class and .ctxt) However, I think that the one exeption, the README.TXT file, 
is in the IDE because it is a file that is supported by the system and thus generatedby said system. Also, every program comes along with a README.TXT file if so desired.
